A collection of scripts to automate tasks related to importing externaly 3D tracked locators into Maya.

02: Creates a polygon Tri from 3 selected locators and sends to "GroundPlane" layer.<br>
03: Creates a polygon Quad from 4 selected locators and sends to "GroundPlane" layer.<br>
04: Selects all objects in layer "GroundPlane" and merges all vertices to create a single object.<br>
05: Creates a new red lambert material.<br>
06: Creates single cone, assigns the red material and moves it to a single locator.<br>
